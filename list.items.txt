$15 IMPORTANT INCOMPLETE WITH 12 data points or more 6. Coordinates.  After adding a tree, create a JSON array in javascript and a function to add coordinates.
        var array_trees = [];
        array_trees.append({
            geo_x: -58.4994
            geo_y: 38.39333
            x_window: 400
            y_window: 39399

// plant a tree given exact coordinates from #6
}

plant_tree({
            geo_x: -58.4994
            geo_y: 38.39333

            other_a: other_a,
            other_b: other_b,
            other_c: other_c
            });
